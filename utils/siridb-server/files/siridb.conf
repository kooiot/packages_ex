# Welcome to the SiriDB configuration file

#
# SiriDB will use this address:port for it's back-end connections.
# This must be an address that other servers can use to connect to.
# For example IPv4, IPv6 or a fqdn are all possible. When using IPv6 be sure
# to wrap the ip address with square brackets. For example [::1]:9010
# The default value is %HOSTNAME:9010. The variable %HOSTNAME will be translate
# to the systems host name.
#
server_name = %HOSTNAME:9010

#
# Listen for SiriDB-server connections only on localhost.
# Use value 0.0.0.0 (or :: for IPv6) to bind to all interfaces.

# and IPv6 addresses.
# Valid options are ALL, IPV4ONLY and IPV6ONLY.

# online.

#
# SiriDB can run fsync on the buffer file on an interval in milliseconds.

# When the HTTP status port is not set (or 0), the service will not start.
# Otherwise the HTTP requests `/status`, `/ready` and `/healthy` are available
# which can be used for readiness and liveness requests.

#
#   wget -q -O - http://siridb-server.local:8080/status
#
